** TODO Keybindings
   We should provide keybindings to do the following:

   - Just perform the expected command without the user having to enter it
     (in tutorial mode)
   - Free roam mode: a mode in which the user can execute any commands and
     experiment in any way.
   - Skip a command without executing it (warning: the rest of the script may
     have unexpected behavior)
   - Show current progress: ~command_no / total_commands~

** TODO Import scripts
   Implement an ~import_script~ (or by another name) function that allows us to
   make scripts that can be run on their own or combined to form a more
   comprehensive tutorial.
