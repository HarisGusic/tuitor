# Example tutorial file

# This is where you configure how tuterm runs the tutorial using shell variables
# All available variables are documented in the manual and in the system
# configuration file
configure() {
    :;
}

# Here you setup the environment for the tutorial. That could mean setting
# environment variables, preparing a directory structure where you will run your
# commands. For example, usually you would like to set HOME to the path where
# you want to run your tutorial.
setup() {
    :;
}

# This is where you design the flow of the tutorial using the interface commands
# like 'cmdline', 'message', etc.
