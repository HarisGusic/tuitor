The tutorial is meant only for non-interacitve demonstrations. You can run the tutorial as

```shell
./tutorial
```

If you want to record the tutorial so you can upload it to [ascinema.org](https://asciinema.org), run

```shell
./record
```

This will create the file `tuterm.cast`. You must have `asciinema` installed for
this to work.

*Note that both scripts must be run from the current directory.*
